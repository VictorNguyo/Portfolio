        <h1 class="subtitle">About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Victor Nguyo. I am astudent in Moringa School, aspiring to be a software developer. I love cars a lot. Like my first car I would ever want to own, would be a fun loud car. Thing is, in one's lifetime, one has to be obsessed in owning or be driven by something loud and fast, if not you need to evaluate on how you look at life for real. I also love indoor activities, aswell as playing games. No matter how much I practice being the best at FIFA, my friends are always going to defeat me brutally on 1V1s. Thats an insider information about me.</p>

            <h3>Colobus Monkey</h3>
            <p>This is my spirit animal. It's not just any regular monkey. It is a <b>Colobus monkey</b>. Colobus monkeys have four-chambered stomachs, that help them break down and digest the nutrients in leaves, a bit like a Jersey cow has several stomachs to help them digest grass. Colobus monkeys are strict leaf-eaters and can digest toxic leaves that would make another primate sick.<br> I wish I would do that!</p>
